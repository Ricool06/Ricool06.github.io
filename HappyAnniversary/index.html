                Happy anniversary Georgina!<br>
                I love that you are always creative with your cards and gifts, so I decided to be too. <br>
                I'm not very good with my hands but I can do things like this. <br>
                I hope you like it.<br>
                <br>
                I love you so much, I really want to be with you for the rest of my life.<br>
                I know we are still going through some tough experiences, and I have not been the best boyfriend,<br>
                but I am proud of you, and how far you have come with your illness and university.<br>
                This last year with you has been fantastic.<br>
                I hope we have a lot more years to come.<br>
                xx
